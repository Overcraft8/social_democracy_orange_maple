@organizing_women

on-arrival: womens_rights += 1; workers_ccf += 4*(1-dissent); rural_ccf += 3*(1-dissent); old_middle_ccf += 3*(1-dissent); advisor_action_timer = 6

Macphail's strategies for organizing women are aimed at working-class housewives, and acknowledge women's traditional household roles. We argue that our economic welfare programs will improve the livelihoods of women and their families.

[? if ccf_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]
