= CP Goals

The CP presents us with a list of goals for the coalition:

[? if welfare_goal = 1 : - Expand social welfare programs. ?]

[? if agriculture_goal = 1 : - Enact a land reform program. ?]

[? if economy_goal = 1 : - Start substantial nationalization of the economy. ?]

[? if finance_goal = 1 : - Make taxes more progressive. ?]

[? if labor_goal = 1 : - Support workers in labor disputes. ?]

[? if foreign_goal = 1 : - Improve our relations with the Soviet Union. ?]

#[? if interior_goal = 1 : - Ban the SA and Stahlhelm. ?]

[? if reichswehr_goal = 1 : - Reduce funding for the Reichswehr. ?]

They say that they expect to see these goals fulfilled in [+ cp_ultimatum_timer +] months. Otherwise, they will vote to dissolve the coalition.
