#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Canada.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The CCF cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the Weimar Coalition of the CCF, RPC, and Democratic parties. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @liberals: Strengthen our bonds with the left-liberal Canadian Democratic Party and conservative-liberal Canadian People's Party.
- @center: Strengthen our bonds with the Catholic RPC Party.
- @cp: Work towards repairing relationships with the Communist Party.
- @ccf_alone: The CCF can stand alone for now.

The communists are suspicious of our overtures, especially the Stalinist leadership, who persist in calling us "social fascists". However, connections are made at the grassroots and local levels.

@cp_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the CP is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The CP is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the CCF "bloodhound" who reportedly ordered the violent suppression of the Spartacist uprising and other CP revolts. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two CCF-turned-CP leaders who were killed during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in CP relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, and hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.
- @no_history: No, we have no need to apologize.

As part of normalizing relations with the CP, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings.

This leads to tensions with the moderates and reformists within our party, and criticism from the conservative and liberal parties.

@no_history
on-arrival: cp_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; it is the Communists' fault for launching a violent insurrection.


@cp_2
on-arrival: cp_relation += 8*(1 - dissent); communist_coalition += 1 if cp_inter_party_seen <= 1; reformist_dissent += 2; rpc_relation -= 3; cpc_relation -= 3

After the success of the coalition government with the CP, they are much more amenable to us.

@cp_blutmai
on-arrival: cp_relation += 3*(1 - dissent); reformist_dissent += 1

After the events of Blütmai, reconciling with the Communists is difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, we must try.

@center_op
on-arrival: rpc_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

We are currently in opposition to the RPC-led government, but that does not preclude the general building of feelings of good will.

@center_coalition
on-arrival: rpc_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

@center_bruning
on-arrival: rpc_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

The Brüning semi-autocratic regime makes building friendly relations difficult, but not impossible.

The [+ lpc_name +] has been one of our closest allies through the course of the Republic.

@cpc_stresemann
on-arrival: cpc_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

Gustav Stresemann, the leader of the CPC is the best foreign policy leaders of the republic, and while he has previously expressed monarchist tendencies, he has been friendly towards us.

@cpc_loss
on-arrival: cpc_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

With the death of Gustav Stresemann, the CPC is much less likely to be accommodating of us. In addition, the liberal parties are electorally in decline, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the CPC among the other right-leaning parties [? if monarch == "George V": and with Monarch George V ?], it can still be helpful to influence them.

@cpc_moribund
on-arrival: cpc_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

The liberal parties (both the [+ lpc_name +] and CPC) are electorally moribund, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the CPC among the other right-leaning parties[? if monarch == "George V": and with Monarch George V ?], it can still be helpful to influence them.

@ccf_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
