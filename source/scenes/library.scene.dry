The Dominion of Canada is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a ceremonial monarch and a dominant lower house, the House of Commons. The leader of the majority party becomes the Prime Minister. The unelected upper house, the Senate of Canada is appointed by the Governor General. The British parliament retains the exclusive power to amend the Canadian constitution. The Governor General is a Monarchial appointee responsible for dissolving Parliament and calling an election. They traditionally defer to the Prime Minister's decision.

The House of Commons is elected using a first-past-the-post system, with the plurality candidate in each electoral district (colloquially called ridings) winning. A majority of the Commons then selects the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is selected by the Prime Minister and are responsible for government. A majority vote-of-no-confidence, including Federal Budget proposals can remove the current government.

Canada is divided into a number of provinces, each of which have their own governments with some responsibilities. By far the largest and most important states are Ontario and Quebec. The CCF is most popular in the Western provinces.

= Timeline of the CCF and the Republic (until 1928)

**1774**: The Quebec Act is signed into law, protecting French civil law and Catholic rights. 

**1867**: Canada is granted Dominion status, allowing it to run its internal affairs. The Liberals and Conservatives become the 2 dominant parties. 

**1870**: The province of Manitoba joins Confederation after the Metis-led Red River Rebellion is crushed. The Red River Rebellion becomes the first symbol of East-West political antagonism in Canada.

**1871**: The province of British Columbia enters Confederataion, having been promised a transcontinental railway to the east. 

**1873**: Prince Edward Island joins Confederation, having been promised more than proportional seats in the Commons. 

**1885**: The Metis-led Northwest Rebellion is crushed by Canadian soldiers arriving through the promised Canadian Pacific Railway. 

**1914-1918**: Canada enters the First World War. Conscription measures lead to riots among the largely anti-war Quebecois population.

**1919**: The Winnipeg General Strike is violently shut down by the RCMP, resulting in 2 deaths and 30 injured. The event would act as a catalyst for the rise in Labour politics across Canada. J.S. Woodsworth would be elected to the Commons in the Winnipeg Centre riding 2 years later.

**1926**: Prime Minister Mackenzie King requests Governor General Byng to dissolve parliament and call an election, suspecting that a recent Liberal scandal would lose them the support of the Progressive Party and therefore, a majority. Byng declines, insisting that Conservative Leader Meighan be given a chance to govern and negotiate with other parties to obtain a majority. Instead, Meighan loses a confidence vote 3 days later, forcing Byng to call an election anyways. 

**1926**: The Statue of Westminster is signed, granting Canada authority over foreign policy and lawmaking, excepting amendments to the constitution. 

**1930-1932**: Conservative Leader R. B. Bennett becomes Prime Minister on a campaign of "blasting" Canada out of the Depression. Instead, 1.5 million Canadians are left in poverty, 10% of the population. Drought across the Prairies, hailed as the "Dirty Thirties" leads to a rise in Farmer co-ops and support for socialist policies amongst rural voters. Bennett's administration constructs work camps for unemployed single men, paying 20 cents a day.

@demographics

**Demographic Groups**

**Working Class**: The urban working class - blue-collar workers in factories, workshops, mines, and the like. Most are socialist, supporting either the CCF or CP. They make up 40-50% of the population.

**Old Mittelstand**: The old middle class consists of independent artisans, shopkeepers, and small-time businesspeople. They tend to be conservative and are the strongest base for the far right. 10-15% of the population.

**New Mittelstand**: The new middle class consists of white-collar workers and government employees. This is the base of liberalism. 10-15% of the population.

**Rural**: Small and large farmers and independent rural workers. Protestant farmers often support the SCP. 20-30% of the population.

**Catholics** are the largest religious minority, at about 30% of the population. They disproportionately support the RPC Party (or the Bavarian People's Party in Bavaria).

**Jews** account for between 0.5% to 1% of the population, and tend to support liberal parties, mostly the LPC, although substantial numbers support the CCF or CP.
